My journey in computer science began in 2013 when I developed a keen interest in understanding computers and programming. This passion led me to pursue an undergraduate degree in Systems Analysis at the esteemed Federal Institute of Rio Grande do Sul (IFRS). During my time at IFRS, I gained a solid theoretical foundation. I had the privilege of interning at reputable companies like Stefanini, Dell, and CWI, which allowed me to apply my knowledge in practical settings. As I approached the culmination of my undergraduate course, I delved into the fascinating realm of Artificial Intelligence. For my final project, I explored how games could serve as an excellent platform for conducting experiments with AI algorithms.

In 2015, I took the next step in my academic journey by enrolling in the Master's program in Computer Science at the prestigious Pontifical Catholic University of Rio Grande do Sul (PUCRS). Driven by my passion for AI, I specialized in Machine Learning and Deep Learning. During this phase, I was honored to receive a full-grant scholarship from Hewlett Packard (HP Brazil) and actively contributed to their project on identifying actions and goals in video sequences. This opportunity allowed me to hone my skills in Python programming and work extensively with various deep learning models for classification and action recognition. My dedication paid off when my work on utilizing action recognition to assist visually impaired individuals earned me the Best Student Paper award at the prestigious IEEE Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN).

In 2017, I proudly graduated with a Master's degree in Computer Science, having completed a thesis that involved using small datasets with deep learning models. My work was well-received, and I was honored with the distinction of having the second-best Master's thesis in Artificial Intelligence by CTDIAC at the Brazilian Conference on Intelligent Systems.

Eager to expand my knowledge and delve deeper into AI research, I embarked on a Ph.D. journey at PUCRS in 2018. My Ph.D. research focused on self-supervised imitation learning involving deep neural networks and agent theory. As I progressed through the Ph.D. program, I was selected by the prestigious CAPES-PrInt program, which allowed me to be an exchange student at the esteemed University of Aberdeen (UoA) in Aberdeen, Scotland. This international exposure enriched my understanding of AI research and allowed me to collaborate with experts in the field.

In parallel with my academic goals, I actively embarked into the industry as a Machine Learning Engineer, specializing in computer vision. My journey in the industry led me to my current role as a Data Scientist at Sicredi Bank, where I continue to leverage Reinforcement Learning and Machine Learning techniques to design and maintain cutting-edge recommendation systems.
