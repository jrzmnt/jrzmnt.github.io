I am graduated in Systems Development and Analysis from the Federal Institute of Rio Grande do Sul ([IFRS](https://ifrs.edu.br/canoas/)), Brazil. During my under graduation, I worked with research in artificial intelligence for agents applied in games. I joined the Hewlett Packard/PUCRS project about the identification of action and goals in video sequences. In that project, I worked with the python language and different deep learning models to construct systems capable of learning actions and activities in a smart environment. During this period, I received the award of the best student paper at IEEE Joint Conference on Neural Networks ([IJCNN](https://www.ijcnn.org/)) to a work that uses action recognition to support visual-impaired people. Two years later, I received a master's degree in Computer Science from the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio Grande do Sul ([PUCRS](http://www.pucrs.br/)) for a thesis involving the usage of small datasets with deep learning models. I was rewarded with the second-best master's thesis in artificial intelligence by CTDIAC at the Brazilian Conference on Intelligent Systems ([CTDIAC](https://bracis2018.mybluemix.net/CTDIAC.html)).

In 2018 at PUCRS with a scholarship from [CAPES](http://www.capes.gov.br/), I started the Ph.D. focusing the research on the self-supervised imitation learning, using deep neural networks and agents theory to get it. During the second year of the Ph.D. I was approved in the CAPES-PrInt program ([PrInt-PUCRS](http://www.pucrs.br/print/)) and become an exchange student in partnership with the University of Aberdeen ([UoA](https://www.abdn.ac.uk/)) located in Aberdeen, Scotland.
I expect to finish the Ph.D. in 2022 with a thesis about self-supervised imitation learning applied in videos.
