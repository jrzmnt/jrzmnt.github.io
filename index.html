    Hello, my name is Juarez Monteiro.

    My career started in 2013, when I decided to study and understand computers and how we can program them. It all
    started when I was approved and allowed to study Systems Analysis (undergraduate) at the Federal Institute of Rio
    Grande do Sul (IFRS). During this period, I had the opportunity to expand my theory by working as an intern for
    several great companies, such as Stefanini, Dell, and CWI. Finally, at the end of my undergraduate course, I got
    exposed to Artificial Intelligence and did my final project about how games can be a great environment to create
    experiments with artificial intelligence algorithms.

    In 2015 I started my Master's in Computer Science at the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio Grande do Sul
    (PUCRS). Influenced by Artificial Intelligence, I chose the Machine and Deep Learning fields. I became a full-grant
    student in partnership with Hewlett Packard (HP Brazil) to join their project about identifying actions and goals in
    video sequences. In this project, I had the chance to develop my skills using the Python program language and
    several deep learning models for classification and action recognition. During this period, I received the best
    student paper award at IEEE Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN) for a work that uses action recognition to
    support visually impaired people. Two years later, In 2017, I received a Master's degree in Computer Science for a
    thesis involving the usage of small datasets with deep learning models. In addition, I was rewarded with the
    second-best Master's thesis in Artificial Intelligence by CTDIAC at the Brazilian Conference on Intelligent Systems.

    In 2018 at PUCRS, I started my Ph.D. focusing on the research on self-supervised imitation learning using deep
    neural networks and agents theory. In the second year of my Ph.D. I was approved in the CAPES-PrInt program to
    become an exchange student in partnership with the University of Aberdeen (UoA) in Aberdeen, Scotland. In addition,
    I joined the industry as a Machine Learning Engineer acting in the computer vision field and later as a Data
    Scientist for Sicredi Bank, where I work today, using Reinforcement and Machine Learning to create and maintain
    recommendation systems.
