    I am graduated in Systems Development and Analysis from the Federal Institute of Rio Grande do Sul
    (<a href="https://ifrs.edu.br/canoas/">IFRS</a>, Brazil. During my under graduation, I worked with research in
    artificial intelligence for agents applied in games. I joined the Hewlett Packard/PUCRS project about the
    identification of
    action and goals in video sequences. In that project, I worked with the python language and different deep learning
    models to construct systems capable of learning actions and activities in a smart environment. During this period, I
    received the award of the best student paper at IEEE Joint Conference on Neural Networks
    (<a href="https://www.ijcnn.org/">IJCNN</a>) to a work that uses action recognition to support visual-impaired
    people. Two
    years later, I received a master's degree in Computer Science from the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio Grande
    do Sul (<a href="http://www.pucrs.br/">PUCRS</a>) for a thesis involving the usage of small datasets with deep
    learning models.
    I was rewarded with the second-best master's thesis in artificial intelligence by CTDIAC at the Brazilian Conference
    on Intelligent Systems (<a href="https://bracis2018.mybluemix.net/CTDIAC.html">CTDIAC</a>).

    In 2018 at PUCRS with a scholarship from (<a href="http://www.capes.gov.br/">CAPES</a>), I started the Ph.D.
    focusing the
    research on the self-supervised imitation learning, using deep neural networks and agents theory to get it. During
    the second year of the Ph.D. I was approved in the CAPES-PrInt program (<a
        href="http://www.pucrs.br/print/">PrInt-PUCRS</a>)
    and become an exchange student in partnership with the University of Aberdeen (<a
        href="https://www.abdn.ac.uk/">UoA</a>)
    located in Aberdeen, Scotland.
    I expect to finish the Ph.D. in 2022 with a thesis about self-supervised imitation learning applied in videos.
